# Email 4: Social Proof — Who's Building What
**Send:** Day 14
**Subject:** What 500+ developers are building with memory

---

Hey {{firstName}},

Our waitlist just hit 500+ developers.

Here's what they're building:

---

### 🎧 Support Bots That Remember

*"We were stuffing 8k tokens of conversation history into every call. Now it's 200 tokens + memory retrieval."*

Before: $4,200/month on inference
After: $1,800/month total (including memory)

**57% reduction.**

---

### 💜 AI Companions That Actually Know You

*"Current AI feels like talking to a stranger every time. Memory is the missing piece."*

Companion apps live or die by emotional connection. Hard to feel connected to something that forgets you exist.

One developer building a journaling AI said: *"My users want it to reference something they mentioned 3 months ago. Without memory, that's impossible."*

---

### 📈 Sales AI That Briefs You

*"Our reps ask 'what do I need to know about Acme Corp?' and the AI actually knows."*

Every conversation with a prospect, summarized and retrievable. No more digging through CRM notes before calls.

---

### 🏥 Healthcare Assistants

Patient intake that remembers previous conversations. Telehealth that doesn't make you repeat your symptoms every visit.

*"HIPAA compliance was our main concern. Per-patient memory isolation solved it."*

---

### The Pattern

Every use case has the same shape:

1. **Repeated context** is eating their budget
2. **Building RAG** is taking forever
3. **Memory** just solves it

---

If you're building AI and context is a problem — it probably should be memory.
