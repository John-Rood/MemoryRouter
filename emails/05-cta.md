# Email 5: CTA — Get Early Access
**Send:** Day 21
**Subject:** Your invite to MemoryRouter

Hey {{firstName}},

We're opening early access this week.

You're on the list.

---

### What you get:

**🎁 50M free tokens** — That's ~37,500 conversations to start

**💰 $0.50 per 1M memory tokens** — No inference markup, ever

**🚀 Sub-50ms retrieval** — Memory that doesn't slow you down

**∞ Unlimited memory keys** — One per user, per project, whatever you need

---

### How it works:

1. Sign up with Google or GitHub
2. Add your provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
3. Get your MemoryRouter key
4. Swap your base URL

**That's it.** Two minutes to persistent memory.

---

### The math one more time:

| Without Memory | With Memory |
|----------------|-------------|
| $5,000/mo inference | $2,000/mo inference |
| 50% wasted on re-context | $450/mo memory |
| — | **$2,550/mo saved** |

---

### Ready?

If you have questions, reply to this email. I read everything and respond personally.

Thanks for following along.

P.S. First 100 users get 100M tokens free instead of 50M. Just because you've been here since the beginning.

*MemoryRouter — $1 on memory saves $10 on inference.*
