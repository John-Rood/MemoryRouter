# Email 1: Welcome — What MemoryRouter Is

**Subject:** The $10 you're leaving on the table

Hey {{firstName}},

Quick math problem:

You spend $1,000/month on AI inference.

50-70% of those tokens are **the same context, repeated every call.**

User preferences. Conversation history. Project details. System prompts bloated with "remember to..." instructions.

You're paying for your AI to re-learn what it already knew.

---

**MemoryRouter fixes this.**

One line of code. Your AI remembers everything.

```javascript
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://api.memoryrouter.ai/v1"  // That's it
});
```

No vector database to manage. No RAG pipeline to build. No embedding models to tune.

Just memory that works.

---

**The pitch in one sentence:**

Every $1 you spend on memory saves $10 on inference.

Over the next few emails, I'll show you exactly how — and why this matters more than most people realize.
