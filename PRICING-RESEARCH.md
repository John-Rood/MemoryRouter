# MemoryRouter Pricing Research & Recommendation

**Research Date:** January 25, 2026  
**Prepared for:** MemoryRouter - AI Memory API

---

## Executive Summary

After researching competitor pricing models (Zep, Mem0, Pinecone, Weaviate) and analyzing best practices in usage-based AI API pricing, I recommend a **value-based hybrid model** designed to maximize profitability while driving viral growth.

### The Money Machine Formula

```
FREE TIER (Growth Engine) → USAGE-BASED (Cash Cow) → ENTERPRISE (Profit Printer)
     Viral loops              High margins              10-100x pricing
```

**Core Pricing Philosophy:**
1. **Free tier = marketing spend** (budget it like ads, measure CAC)
2. **Usage tier = 80%+ margins** (price on VALUE saved, not cost)
3. **Enterprise = pure profit** (compliance/SLA features cost nothing, worth everything)

**The Big Insight:** MemoryRouter saves users 3-10x on AI inference costs. If we save them $100, we can charge $20-30 and they're still thrilled. **We're not selling storage—we're selling AI efficiency.**

---

## 💰 Pricing Psychology & Revenue Maximization

### The Value Equation (This Is Everything)

**Without MemoryRouter:**
- Claude Opus: $15/$75 per 1M tokens (input/output)
- User re-sends 50K tokens of context per request = $0.75/request
- 1,000 requests/day = **$750/day = $22,500/month wasted**

**With MemoryRouter:**
- Memory retrieval: ~2K tokens of targeted context
- Cost: $0.03/request + memory fee
- Same 1,000 requests = **$30/day + ~$300/mo memory = $1,200/month**

**User saves: $21,300/month. We charge $300. They're ecstatic.**

This is the anchor for ALL pricing conversations. We're not charging for storage—**we're selling a 10-20x ROI on AI spend.**

---

### Pricing Psychology Tactics

#### 1. Anchoring (Show Enterprise First)
```
Landing page pricing order:
ENTERPRISE $2,499/mo  →  PRO $299/mo  →  GROWTH $49/mo  →  Free
    "Wow that's                "Actually           "This is
     expensive"                reasonable"          nothing!"
```
The $2,499 makes $299 feel like a steal.

#### 2. Usage Anxiety (Create Awareness)
- Real-time usage dashboard on every page
- Weekly "Memory Report" emails: "Your AI recalled memories 2,847 times"
- Push notifications at 50%, 75%, 90% of limits
- **Show the VALUE**: "Your memories saved ~$847 in inference costs this month"

#### 3. Loss Aversion (Make Switching Expensive)
- "Memory Value Score™" - proprietary metric showing memory quality
- "Your knowledge graph has 847 connections"
- "Semantic relationships built: 12,493"
- Export gives raw data but LOSES the graph/relationships
- **Never threaten deletion—show what they'd lose**

#### 4. Decoy Pricing (Make Pro Irresistible)
| Growth | **PRO** ← Target | Enterprise |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| $49/mo | **$299/mo** | $2,499/mo |
| 50K memories | **500K memories** | Unlimited |
| 25K API calls | **500K API calls** | Unlimited |
| Email support | **Slack + Priority** | Dedicated CSM |
| | **10x value, 6x price** | |

#### 5. Artificial Scarcity
- "Free tier limited to first 10,000 users" (creates urgency)
- "Founding member pricing" - 20% off forever if you upgrade in first 30 days
- "Enterprise beta program" - limited slots for white-glove onboarding

### How to Make Enterprise Pay 10-100x More

**The Enterprise Multiplier Stack:**

| Feature | Cost to You | Value to Them | Markup |
|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| SOC 2 Type II | $50K one-time | "We can use you" | ∞ |
| HIPAA BAA | $10K/year | Healthcare = unlocked | ∞ |
| 99.99% SLA | $0 (you try anyway) | "Insurance policy" | ∞ |
| Dedicated instance | ~$500/mo | "Security requirement" | 5-10x |
| SSO/SAML | $0 (library exists) | "Enterprise checkbox" | ∞ |
| Audit logs | $0 (you log anyway) | "Compliance requirement" | ∞ |
| Custom retention | $0 | Legal requirement | ∞ |
| Named CSM | $5K/mo loaded cost | "They care about us" | 3-5x |

**Enterprise Pricing Formula:**
```
Base usage cost × 3 (SLA premium)
+ Compliance package ($500-2000/mo)
+ Per-seat fee ($50-100/seat) ← THIS IS KEY
+ Platform fee ($500-1000/mo)
= $2,500 - $25,000+/month
```

**The Per-Seat Hack:**
- Usage-based for small teams (they self-select)
- Per-seat for enterprise (they have budget per employee)
- 100 developers × $50/seat = $5,000/mo BEFORE usage
- Enterprise thinks in "cost per developer" not "cost per API call"

---

### Viral/Referral Mechanics

#### 1. Credit-Based Referral Program
- Refer a friend → Both get 10,000 bonus memories
- Referred user converts → Referrer gets $50 credit
- **Gamify it**: Leaderboard of top referrers, monthly prizes

#### 2. "Powered by MemoryRouter" Badge
- Free tier users MUST show badge in their app
- Badge links to MemoryRouter with referral code
- Upgrade to remove badge (Pro+)
- **Every free user becomes a billboard**

#### 3. Open Source SDK + Attribution
- SDK is MIT licensed but includes telemetry (opt-out)
- Default: sends anonymous usage stats
- Creates awareness: "10,000+ apps use MemoryRouter"

#### 4. Team Viral Loop
- Free tier: 1 user
- Invite teammates: First 3 teammates free
- Need more? Upgrade to Pro
- **Each invite = potential future buyer**

#### 5. Content/Integration Virality
- "Build with MemoryRouter" tutorials
- Integration showcases (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.)
- Hackathon sponsorships with free credits
- **Dev advocates spread the word**

| Flex Plus | $475/mo | 300,000 credits | 1,000 RPM, webhooks, 7-day API logs |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom limits | SOC 2, HIPAA, SLA guarantees |

**Pricing Model:** Credit-based (charged per "episode" of ingestion/processing)
- Unused credits roll over 60 days
- Storage is FREE (smart move for stickiness)
- $2,500 credit for VC-funded startups

**Takeaway:** Zep charges for compute/processing, not storage. This encourages data accumulation (sticky).

---

### Mem0 (Direct Competitor - Memory Layer for LLMs)
| Plan | Price | Memories | API Calls/mo |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | 10,000 | 1,000 retrieval |
| Starter | $19/mo | 50,000 | 5,000 retrieval |
| Pro | $249/mo | Unlimited | 50,000 retrieval |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited |

**Pricing Model:** Tier-based with memory counts + API call limits
- Also offers open-source self-hosted option
- Claims 90% token reduction vs full-context methods
- Recently raised $24M (funded competitor)

**Takeaway:** Mem0's free tier (10,000 memories) is generous and creates investment. The jump to $249 for "unlimited" is steep—opportunity for MemoryRouter.

---

### Pinecone (Vector Database - Adjacent Competitor)
| Plan | Price | Model |
|------|-------|-------|
| Starter | Free | 2GB storage, 2M writes, 1M reads/mo |
| Standard | $50/mo min | $0.33/GB storage + read/write units |
| Enterprise | $500/mo min | Custom, dedicated support |

**Pricing Model:** Pure usage-based (storage GB + operations)
- Storage: $0.33/GB/month
- Read operations: Per read unit (RU)
- Write operations: Per write unit (WU)

**Takeaway:** Infrastructure-focused pricing. Works for technical users but can be confusing. MemoryRouter should be simpler.

---

### Weaviate (Vector Database - Adjacent Competitor)
| Plan | Price | Model |
|------|-------|-------|
| Free Trial | $0 | 14 days, shared cluster |
| Flex | $45/mo+ | Pay-as-you-go, ~$0.095 per 1M vector dims |
| Premium | $400/mo+ | Prepaid, dedicated options |

**Pricing Model:** Dimension-based (vectors × dimensionality)
- Storage and backups charged separately
- Regional pricing variations

**Takeaway:** Technical pricing tied to vector dimensions. Good for ML engineers, confusing for app developers.

## 🎯 Recommended Pricing Model for MemoryRouter

### The "Memory Machine" Model (Profit-Optimized)

**Design Principles:**
1. Free tier = customer acquisition cost (treat it like ad spend)
2. Usage pricing = value-based, not cost-based (80%+ margins)
3. Tiers exist to capture different willingness-to-pay
4. Enterprise = compliance theater + high-touch = maximum profit

---

### 🆓 FREE TIER - "Starter" (Growth Engine)

| Resource | Limit | Psychology |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Memories | **5,000** | Enough to get hooked, not enough to run production |
| API Calls | **1,000/mo** | Forces thoughtful usage, creates scarcity |
| Storage | Unlimited | **Never charge for storage** (sticky data) |
| Projects | 1 | Team features = upgrade trigger |
| Rate Limit | 30 req/min | Feels limiting in production |
| Retention | 90 days | Creates urgency to upgrade |
| Badge | **Required** | "Powered by MemoryRouter" = free marketing |

**Why 5,000 not 10,000:**
- 10K is generous for production use (bad)
- 5K is perfect for prototyping, painful for prod (good)
- Creates urgency faster without feeling cheap
- Mem0 gives 10K = we differentiate on quality, not quantity

**Free Tier Exit Triggers:**
- Hit memory limit → Upgrade prompt
- Hit API limit → Upgrade prompt
- Add second team member → Upgrade prompt
- Need >30 RPM → Upgrade prompt
- Want to remove badge → Upgrade prompt

## 📈 Financial Projections (Money Machine Mode)

### Unit Economics

| Metric | Free | Growth ($49) | Pro ($299) | Enterprise ($8K avg) |
|--------|------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Infra cost/user | $0.50 | $7 | $50 | $500 |
| Support cost/user | $0 | $2 | $15 | $300 |
| **Total cost** | **$0.50** | **$9** | **$65** | **$800** |
| **Revenue** | **$0** | **$49** | **$299** | **$8,000** |
| **Gross Profit** | **-$0.50** | **$40** | **$234** | **$7,200** |
| **Margin** | N/A | **82%** | **78%** | **90%** |

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Model

**Free tier as marketing:**
- Free users cost ~$0.50/mo in infrastructure
- 1,000 free users × $0.50 × 12 months = $6,000/year
- If 5% convert to paid = 50 paying customers
- CAC = $6,000 / 50 = **$120/customer**
- LTV of Growth customer (24mo avg): $49 × 24 = **$1,176**
- **LTV:CAC = 9.8x** ✅

### Revenue Model (Conservative)

**Assumptions:**
- 1,500 free signups/month (growing 10%/mo)
- 5% Free → Growth conversion
- 20% Growth → Pro upgrade rate
- 2% Pro → Enterprise conversion
- 4% monthly churn (Growth), 2% (Pro), 1% (Enterprise)

| Month | Free | Growth | Pro | Enterprise | MRR | ARR |
|-------|------|--------|-----|------------|-----|-----|
| 3 | 4,500 | 180 | 18 | 1 | **$16,709** | $200K |
| 6 | 8,000 | 420 | 60 | 4 | **$51,000** | $612K |
| 12 | 18,000 | 900 | 180 | 15 | **$182,500** | $2.2M |
| 24 | 50,000 | 2,200 | 600 | 50 | **$634,000** | $7.6M |

### Revenue Mix at Month 24

| Tier | Customers | MRR | % of Revenue |
|------|-----------|-----|--------------|
| Growth ($49) | 2,200 | $107,800 | 17% |
| Pro ($299) | 600 | $179,400 | 28% |
| Enterprise ($8K) | 50 | $400,000 | **63%** |

**Key insight:** Enterprise is 2% of customers but 63% of revenue. **Hunt whales.**

### Expansion Revenue (Net Dollar Retention)

Great SaaS companies have NDR > 120%. With usage-based pricing:

- Customers naturally use more over time
- Overage charges on Growth/Pro
- Team seat expansion
- Enterprise upsells (compliance packages)

**Target NDR: 130%** = Every cohort grows 30%/year just from expansion
